# **Semantic Song Grouping**

This project showcases how machine learning can be used to cluster song lyrics based on their meaning. By analyzing the embeddings of the lyrics' text, it's possible to identify groups of songs with similar themes or content. The final clusters are saved in a JSON file, making it easy to explore and understand the relationships between different lyrics.

---
## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. Embedding Generation: Each song lyric is processed to generate a numerical embedding representing its semantic meaning. In this case, `text-embedding-3-large` model from OpenAI was used.

2.  Normalization: The generated embeddings are normalized to ensure proper scaling for clustering.

3. Clustering: The normalized embeddings are clustered using the **DBSCAN** algorithm using the cosine distance.

4. Results: The final clusters are saved in a JSON file located at **`outputs/clusters.json`**.

## üíª Technologies Used

- Python: Core programming language.

- OpenAI API: Used to generate embeddings with the text-embedding-3-large model.

- NumPy: For numerical computations.

- Scikit-learn: For normalization and clustering (DBSCAN algorithm).

- Cache Decorator: To cache embedding results and optimize performance

## üìä Dataset

The dataset consists of song lyrics saved as text files in the data directory. Each file contains lyrics from popular songs across various artists and genres. Below are the included songs:

| **Artist**        | **Song**                          | **File**                                      |

| Queen              | Somebody to Love                 | `somebody-to-love-queen.txt`                  |
| The Beatles        | Let It Be                        | `let-it-be-the-beatles.txt`                   |
| Gracie Abrams      | That's So True                   | `thats-so-true-gracie-abrams.txt`             |
| Ariana Grande      | We Can't Be Friends              | `we-cant-be-friends-ariana-grande.txt`        |
| Pink Floyd         | Wish You Were Here               | `wish-you-were-here-pink-floyd.txt`           |
| Eminem             | Without Me                       | `without-me-eminem.txt`                       |

## üîé Results 

The clustering results are saved in the **`outputs/clusters.json`** file. Each song lyric file is assigned a cluster ID, as shown below:

| **File**                                  | **Cluster** |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `forever-toung-alphaville.txt`            | 0           |
| `drop-it-like-its-hot-snooop-dogg.txt`    | 1           |
| `without-me-eminem.txt`                   | 1           |
| `dancing-queen-abba.txt`                  | 0           |
| `cardigan-taylor-swift.txt`               | 2           |
| `somebody-to-love-queen.txt`              | 3           |
| `we-cant-be-friends-ariana-grande.txt`    | 2           |
| `thats-so-true-gracie-abrams.txt`         | 2           |
| `shake-it-off-taylor-swift.txt`           | 2           |
| `let-it-be-the-beatles.txt`               | 3           |
| `creep-radiohead.txt`                     | 0           |
| `wish-you-were-here-pink-floyd.txt`       | 0           |

### Cluster Interpretation

- Cluster 0: Includes songs like "Forever Young" and "Creep" that may share similar emotional or lyrical themes.

- Cluster 1: Groups hip-hop/rap songs, such as "Drop It Like It's Hot" and "Without Me".

- Cluster 2: Groups pop songs, including tracks from Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, and Gracie Abrams.

- Cluster 3: Groups classic rock and pop songs, like "Somebody to Love" and "Let It Be".
