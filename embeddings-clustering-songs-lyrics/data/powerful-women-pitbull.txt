(Who runs this? Who runs this?)
It's Mr. Worldwide
(Who runs this? Who runs this?)
With the one and only Dolly Parton
(Who runs this? Who runs this?)
Well, hey
And this is dedicated to (Who runs this?)

All my powerful women working nine to five
Two, three jobs just to survive
All my powerful women, no man at home
Raisin' all the kids alone
All my powerful women, y'all deserve a throne
Keep your head up and stay strong
All my powerful women, no matter what
Never give up (Ayo)

I remember workin' hard with my mom, you name it, she did it
You name it, she sewed it (Yeah), you name it, she clеaned it (Yeah)
You name it, shе owed it (Yeah), she had to provide (Yeah)
We had to survive, so you name it, she stole it, ha (Woo)
Our whole life was layaway
Pay, pay, pay, but the bills never went away (Pay, pay, pay)
Put your hands to the sky
This goes out to the women working hard nine to five

Workin' nine to five (Nine to five), what a way to make a livin' (Yeah)
Barely gettin' by (Get it, girl), it's all takin' and no givin' (Haha)
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five (nine to five), for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead, the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me

Break it down (Ooh)
Here's to your mama and here's to mine
Take it, Dolly
Dale
Haha

Mama worked hard her entire life
She had twelve kids at thirty-five (Woo)
Working 24/7, 365
Working five to nine and nine to five
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
You got dreams he'll never take away (Never take away)
You're all in the same boat with the luck of your friends
Waiting for the day your ship will come in
Tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll you away

Workin' nine to five (Nine to five), what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by (I'm gettin by), it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind (They use your mind) and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, for service and devotion (That's just what I want)
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead, but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me (He's out to get me)
Break it down (Ooh)

Here's to Jane and Lilly and the girls that fight
For equal pay, equal rights
Now, some of us are pitbulls too
We appreciate the things you do
Thanks again for shinin' light
On the women that work from nine to five

It's my pleasure
