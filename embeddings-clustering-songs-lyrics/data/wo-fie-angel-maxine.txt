I been living my life in the abyss
As I start to shine, then, they fear
They worry, oh, worry
Say "why I live my life like this?"
I'm sorry, oh, sorry
I do not live my life to please you
They worry, oh, worry
Say "why I live my life like this?"
I′m sorry, oh, sorry
Actually, I'm not sorry

LGBT, that be wona culture
Love everyone, that be wona culture
Bible no bi wona culture
Quran no bi wona culture
The only sin is homophobia
Yerebedi yen ho a, yenhwe obiara
Corruption bebreebe yi nyinaa, eye musuo
Se wode wo gyimii (tsww) ba me so, me dee mebo wo tuo
Bushoon bushoon, papa bi te se 'sini
Meye nnipa papa no bi, Ghanani, obibini
My sexing 'things' is not your palava
Find a politician to bother and leave my lover
What kind skin pain be this?
Which you dey do hate campaign, and resist
Wey you dey live righteously and above
Didn't Jesus Christ teach you to love?

Why do you want to hate
Somebody who did not do you any bad?
Why? Why, why?
And why can′t you just love
Your neighbour as yourself as you must?
It's nice to be nice
Your driver could be LGBTQ
Your tailor could be LGBTQ
Hairdresser could be LGBTQ
Your plumber could be LGBTQ
Your doctor could be LGBTQ
Your teacher could be LGBTQ
Your bestie could be LGBTQ

I can't understand how anybody
Would be more outraged by activities
Between two consenting adults
And nobody has complained to anybody
Is all I'm saying
