Wake up in the mornin' feeling like P. Diddy (Hey, what up, girl?)
Grab my glasses; I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city (Let's go!)
Before I leave, brush my teeth, with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night I ain't comin' back
I'm talkin' pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowin' up our phones, phones
Drop-toppin', playin' our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to the parties
Tryin' to get a little bit tipsy
Don't stop, make it pop, D.J., blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, whoa-oh
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, whoa-oh
Don't stop, make it pop, D.J., blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, whoa-oh
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, whoa-oh
Ain't got a care in the world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now the dudes are linin' up 'cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger
I'm talkin' 'bout everybody gettin' crunk, crunk
Boys tryin' to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he gettin' too drunk, drunk
Now, now we go until they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down, po-po-, shut us (Down)
Don't stop, make it pop, D.J., blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, whoa-oh
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, whoa-oh
Don't stop, make it pop, D.J., blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, whoa-oh
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, whoa-oh
D.J., you build me up, you break me down
My heart, it pounds, yeah, you got me
With my hands up, you got me now
You got that sound, yeah, you got me
D.J., you build me up, you break me down
My heart, it pounds, yeah, you got me
With my hands up, put your hands up
Put your hands up
Now, the party don't start 'til I walk in
Don't stop, make it pop, D.J., blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, whoa-oh
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, whoa-oh
Don't stop, make it pop, D.J., blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, whoa-oh
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, whoa-oh
