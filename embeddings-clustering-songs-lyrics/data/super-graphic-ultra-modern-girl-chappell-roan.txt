You know what they say, "Never waste a Friday night on a first date"
But there I was, in my heels with my hair straight
And so, I take him to this bar; this man wouldn't dance
He didn't ask a single question
And he was wearing these fugly jeans (Ew)
It doesn't matter though
He doesn't have what it takes to be
With a girl like me

(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Not overdramatic, I know what I want
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
We're leaving the planet, and you can't come

(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Not overdramatic, I know what I want
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
We're leaving the planet, and you can't come

Telling secrets there on the mattress
Wearing nothing but glitter and lashes
At every party, we're the party, shaking our asses
Making out while the world collapses

(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Not overdramatic, I know what I want
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
We're leaving the planet, and you can't come

Uh-huh, I'm through
With all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need
A super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk, wow
Look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Oh yeah, I need
A super graphic ultra modern girl like me (Shake it for me)

Get up off your feet, get up on that bar
Walk that walk from Tokyo to New York
With everything you feel and everything you are
Walk that walk, flash the camera, flash the camera, flash the camera
You're a star

Uh-huh, I'm through
With all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need
A super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk, wow
Look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Oh yeah, I need
A super graphic ultra modern, oh, you got me, "La-la-la"-in'
Hyper-sexy top to bottom girl like me
