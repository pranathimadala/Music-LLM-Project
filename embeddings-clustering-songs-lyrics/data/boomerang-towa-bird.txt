Every time that you leave
It's like a kick in the teeth
Separation anxiety
'Cause when we're apart
It's like I have to restart (Start, start)
I'm so bored of the space between (Space between)

New York City never felt so sad
But if you were to miss me, would it be so bad?

Oh my, my, my maniac
My skipping stone, I'm tryna catch
I can't sleep, can't eat, can't breathe
My beating heart just can't relax
Leave me like a boomerang
I know you're coming back
Leave me like a boomerang
I know you're coming back

Maybe I'm being dramatic
Or is it romantic?
My nervous system's breaking down
And I'm missing you, girl (Girl)
And I hate that it feels like the end of the world
It's turning me inside out (Inside out)

New York City never felt so sad
But if you were to miss me, would it be so bad?

Oh my, my, my maniac
My skipping stone, I'm tryna catch
I can't sleep, can't eat, can't breathe
My beating heart just can't relax
Leave me like a boomerang
I know you're coming back (I know you're coming back)
Leave me like a boomerang
I know you're coming back (I know you're coming—)

Oh my, my, my maniac
My skipping stone, I'm tryna catch
I can't sleep, can't eat, can't breathe
My beating heart just can't relax
Leave me like a boomerang
I know you're coming back (I know you're coming back)
Leave me like a boomerang
I know you're coming back (I know you're coming—)
