You are
Face to Face now
Face to Face
You are
Face to Face now
With me
You are
Face to Face now
Face to Face
You are
Face to Face now
With me

You are
Dancing
You are
Dancing

You are
Face to Face now
Face to Face
You are
Face to Face now
With me

What's going on? Could this be my understanding?
It's not your fault, I was being too demanding
I must admit, it's my pride that made me distant
All because, I hoped that you'd be someone different

There's not much I know about you
Fear will always make you blind
But the answer is in clear view
It's amazing what you'll find face to face

You are
Face to Face now
Face to Face
You are
Face to Face now
With me
You are
Face to Face now
Face to Face
You are
Face to Face now
With me

I turned away, 'cause I thought you were the problem
Tried to forget, until I hit the bottom
But when I faced you in my blank confusion
I realised you weren't wrong, was a mere illusion

It really didn't make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
It's not hard to go the distance
When you finally get involved face to face

You are
Face to Face now
Face to Face
You are
Face to Face now
With me

You are
Dancing
You are
Dancing

You are
Face to Face now
Face to Face
You are
Face to Face now
With me

It really didn't make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
It's not hard to go the distance
When you finally get involved face to face
