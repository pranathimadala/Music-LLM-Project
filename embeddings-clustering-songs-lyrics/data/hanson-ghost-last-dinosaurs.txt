Point in time
It feels crazy to describe
When all the stars align
But the world just feels beautiful
Moving fast, but we're slowing down at last
I feel good in my skin again
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Getting sick of waking up
Every morning, feeling tired
Feeling pressured to wake up
Another seven AM flight

And I'm feeling rude
I wouldn't talk to me
Been acting a fool
Living on three hours sleep

Point in time
It feels crazy to describe
When all the stars align
But the world just feels beautiful
Moving fast, but we're slowing down at last
I feel good in my skin again
Ooh, ooh-ooh

I feel good in my skin again

I've been drinking way too much
Living up a vicious cycle
And I just miss my fucking dog
He doesn't judge people like I do

And I've been glued to my phone screen
And I'm in a mood
'Cause I just wanna be

Cuanto mas debo esperar?
Cuanto mas debo esperar?

Point in time
It feels crazy to describe
When all the stars align
But the world just feels beautiful
Moving fast, but we're slowing down at last
I feel good in my skin again
Ooh, ooh-ooh

I feel good in my skin again
I feel good in my skin again
(Cuanto mas debo esperar?)
I feel good in my skin again
(Cuanto mas debo esperar?)
I feel good in my skin again
