What if?
What if I'm the one for you?
And you're the one for me?
What if?

If you are the one
Then us meeting here is fate, uh
Future with a dog named Red
Buy a house with a fireplace
This is the first I've seen your face
But there's a chance we are soulmates
I know that this might sound crazy
'Cause you don't know my name

But we can't, we can't tell the future, no
But that's just the beauty of the world we know
So I'ma say doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Baby, what if
We all can say doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Baby, what if

What if (What if)
What if (What if)
What if (What if)
What if

Yeah, picture me on one knee
With the perfect diamond ring (Perfect diamond ring)
We just met, but if you say, "Yes"
We'd have our wedding on the beach (Oh)
It could happen, raise three kids
And we grow old, oh, so happily
I know this might sound crazy
'Cause I don't know your name

But we can't (We can't), we can't tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
So I'ma say doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Baby, what if
We all can say doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Baby, what if

Don't know what tomorrow brings, but I'm still hoping
That you are the one for me
Oh and what if I had you and what if you had me and
Baby, what's the reason we can't fall in love?
What if (What if)
What if (What if)
What if, oh, woah

But we can't, we can't tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
So I'ma say doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Baby, what if
We all can say doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo (Yeah)
Baby, what if
But we can't (We can't), we can't (Ooh) tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
So I'ma say doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo (Singing oh)
Baby, what if
We all can say doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Baby, what if
