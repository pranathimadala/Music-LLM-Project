Hello?
Last night, you called on accident
Heard you fuckin' on the other end
It's too late, it'll never be the same again
Too late, never be the same
Said last night was a fluke and you know it
This shit that we doin' so bogus
Can we keep it up?
I'm not strong enough
Boo'd up, got me so screwed up
I wish you all of the best
Even though you with that bitch, you know
I get emotional, it's hard to shut it off
You're still the one that get me though, you so reliable
That's why I ride for you, damn right, I'd die for you
