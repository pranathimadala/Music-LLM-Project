You say I got a reckless streak
In my snakeskin boots and Levi's jeans
I think you got a wicked smile
And those angel eyes
With timeless style

I could smoke you out
For fun, in my leather vest
I love you 'till the death
You're a bullet in my chest

(Oh, you)
I can't believe that you
Could tame my wild wild heart
I can't believe that you
Could tame my wild wild heart

I'm pretty quick, shoot from the hip
With words that whip, but I'm in your grip
Throw your lasso
Come and catch me, babe
I'm Indiana jones
You're my last crusadе

I could smoke you out
For fun, in my leather vеst
I love you 'till the death
You're a bullet in my chest
Gravel in my throat and
Sweetness on my tongue
This ain't my first rodeo
My bad, I should have known

(Oh, you)
I can't believe that you
Could tame my wild wild heart
(You)
I can't believe that you
Could tame my wild wild heart
(You)
I can't believe that you
Could tame my wild wild heart
(You)
I can't believe that you
Could tame my wild wild heart
(You)

The open road is the loneliest
Come ride by my side
Into the sunset

I could smoke you out
For fun, in my leather vest
I love you till the death
You’re a bullet in my chest

(Oh, you)
I can't believe that you
Could tame my wild wild heart
(You)
I can't believe that you
Could tame my wild wild heart
(You)
I can't believe that you
Could tame my wild wild heart
(You)
I can't believe that you
Could tame my wild wild heart

My wild wild heart
My wild wild heart
