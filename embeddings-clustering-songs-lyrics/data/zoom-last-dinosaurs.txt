You know we're not the only one
To say the boy that you
Hold very close to you
He's not your kind of guy
I hope you realise

I have no care for answers 'cause
Now you're standing lonely next to me, oh
So take me on a tangent
'Cause tangible is something we perceive, oh

I don't want to be just another
Fighter without fire, nothing to inspire
In a million years when we're older
Finally we can be part of history

From retrospective points of view
It's time to reinvent
Don't care to what extent
Subconscious disarray
I want to look away
I'll live for shadow play

I can't tell the difference
When everyone's pretending to play ball, oh
Now I'm all for resistance
But I can't take it anymore, oh

I don't want to be just another
Fighter without fire, nothing to inspire
In a million years when we're older
Finally we can be part of history
I don't want to be just another
Fighter without fire, nothing to inspire
In a million years when we're older
Finally we can be part of history
Finally we can be part of history

(Yeah, you want to know just how I cope)
I told you
I tell myself, it's alright
Alright, alright, oh-oh

I don't want to be just another
Fighter without fire, nothing to inspire
In a million years when we're older
Finally we can be part of history
I don't want to be just another
Fighter without fire, nothing to inspire
In a million years when we're older
Finally we can be part of history
Finally we can be part of history
