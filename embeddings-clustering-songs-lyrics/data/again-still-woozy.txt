Yeah?
Tell me how you feel

In the back of the bus tonight
We got away from the wandering eye
We'll take it as it comes right now
And somehow, we are alone
And you touch my arm
Cold hands, my good luck charm
Oh, baby, it's been too long to feel this strong

But I hear a moan
And you leave me
Baby, here on my own
Well, I should have known
So completely
Baby, I've been so wrong

Again
Again
This can't be happening
I must be daydreaming
Again
Again
Never ever again
Until the morning

Sun is up and you're next to me
My head still blurry
Should we hang out and go for a walk or just talk?
It's up to you
And you takе my hand
And stand to face your man
I know it's too good to be, that won't stop me

But I hеar a moan
And you leave me
Baby, here on my own
Aw, throw me a bone
Oh, believe me
Baby, I've been so wrong

Again
Again
This can't be happening
I must be daydreaming
Again
Again
Never ever again
Until the morning
Again
Again
