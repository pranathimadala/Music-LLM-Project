Christopher Robin and I walked along
Under branches lit up by the moon
Posing our questions to Owl and Eeyore
As our days disappeared all too soon
But I've wandered much further today than I should
And I can't seem to find my way back to the wood, so

Help me if you can
I've got to get back to the house at Pooh Corner by one
You'd be surprised
There's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky (Chase the clouds away)
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh

Winnie the Pooh doesn't know what to do
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose
He came to me asking help and advice
And from here no one knows where he goes
So I sent him to ask of the Owl if he's there
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear

Help me if you can
I've got to get back to the house at Pooh Corner by one
You'd be surprised
There's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky (Chase the clouds away)
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh

It's hard to explain how a few precious things
Seem to follow throughout all our lives
After all's said and done I was watching my son
Sleeping there with my bear by his side
So I tucked him in, I kissed him, and as I was going
I swear that old bear whispered, "Boy, welcome home"

Believe me if you can
I've finally come
Back to the house at Pooh Corner by one
What do you know? There's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky (Chase the clouds away)
Back to the days of Christopher Robin (Back to the days)
Back to the ways of Christopher Robin (Back to the ways)
Back to the days of Pooh
