Cola, Cola bottle shape, baby
You're freaking me out, girl
Cola, Cola bottle shape, baby
You're freaking me out, girl

(You can get it)
But I don't get none
(You can get it)
'Cause you been fooling me
(You can get it)
Pensacola girl's made a fool out of me

Oh, when you look into her eyes
You can believe all the lies, the lies
And the alibis

Cola, Cola bottle shape, baby
You're freaking me out, baby
Cola, Cola bottle shape, baby
I love the way you dance, baby
Cola, Cola bottle shape, girl
Freaking my mind out

(You can get it)
But that's just a lie
(You can get it)
You give her the feared sense of alibi
(You can get it)

Oh, when you look into her eyes
That's when you start, start to cry
'Cause you believe all the lies

Coke bottle shape
Yeah, she's got the Pep
She's got the Pepsi good taste
7-Up fizz, fizz
Fizz, fizz, fizz, fizz, fizz
She makes me fizz, fizz, fizz, fizz
Leaves you sugar free
Fizz, fizz, fizz, fizz, fizz
She makes you sugar free, fizz
Fizz, fizz, fizz, fizz, fizz, fizz, fizz

Coke bottle shape, baby
Freaking my mind out
So far out, oh, out
Cola bottle shape, baby
Freaking my mind out

(You can get it)
But that's just a lie
(You can get it)
Pensacola girl's made a fool out of you
(You can get it)

Oh, when you look into her eyes
That's when you sigh
'Cause you believe all the lies and alibis

Coke bottle shape
Fizz, fizz, fizz, fizz, fizz
She's got that Pepsi good taste
7-Up fizz, fizz
Fizz, fizz, fizz, fizz, fizz
She makes me fizz, fizz, fizz, fizz
Leaves you sugar free
