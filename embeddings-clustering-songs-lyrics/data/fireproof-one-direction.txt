I think I'm gonna lose my mind
Something deep inside me, I can't give up
I think I'm gonna lose my mind
I roll and I roll 'til I'm out of luck
Yeah, I roll and I roll 'til I'm out of luck (Ah)
I'm feeling something deep inside (Ah)
Hotter than a jet stream burning up (Ah)
I got a feeling deep inside (Ah)
It's taking, it's taking all I've got (Ah)
Yeah, it's taking, it's taking all I've got

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do
It's been so long, it's been so long, maybe you were fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do

I think I'm gonna win this time
Ridin' on the wind and I won't give up
I think I'm gonna win this time
I roll and I roll 'til I change my luck
Yeah, I roll and I roll 'til I change my luck (Ah)

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do
It's been so long (Ah), it's been so long, you must be fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do
('Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do)
(And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do)
It's been so long, it's been so long (Ah), maybe you were fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do
