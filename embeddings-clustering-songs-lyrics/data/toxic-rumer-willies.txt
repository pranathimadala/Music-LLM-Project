Baby can't you see I'm callin'
A guy like you should wear a warnin'
It's dangerous, I'm fallin'
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, gimme it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin it

Too high, can't come down
It's in my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

With a taste of your lips I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slipping under
Taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic?

It's getting late, to give you up
I took a sip, from the devil's cup
Slowly, it's takin' over me

Too high, can't come down
It's in my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

With a taste of your lips I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slipping under
Taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?

Don't you know that you're toxic (Toxic)
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready now
