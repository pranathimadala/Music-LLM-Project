And when I think
Of everything that we did together
Somewhere in Verona
The sun set over our time together
Thinking it over
So young and sentimental
Our hearts so gentle
Such a shame we had to drift apart

Oh, but I can't help just wonder
Could we really last forever?
I watch the sunset and
Something's telling me that I gotta get up and chase it

Day of transit
The gentle weight of your head on my shoulder
I wake you at the last stop
Your sleepy eyes in the gloomy weather
Raining in Florence
Your cold hands and your wet hair
While we're cursing
Cheap umbrellas trying to get home

Now we're written in history
We close the book weâ€™ve opened up
There will always be a place in my heart
But baby can't you see we were meant to fall apart

We gave it up
Who would have thought love wasn't enough
In the end we'd say
"Bye my love, guess I'll see you someday"
