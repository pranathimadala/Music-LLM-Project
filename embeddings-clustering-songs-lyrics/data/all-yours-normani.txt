There's somethin' about you I'm likin'
Bit too much, it's a bit frightenin'
Got a bit of bite to you like Python
Got a bit of fight to you like Tyson
I'm a fan, you say I'm like Dyson
Never planned to be in like I'm in
How you could put the cherry on this cake and make it icin'? (Oh)

Said, "Mm, that's all mine, spread
Mm, like a wildfire, like"
Mm, I don't mind, like
Mm, let's go twice, like (Ah)
Flip it, go, flip it (Ah)
Drippin' all in it
This kitty got that Midas touch
You turn to gold in it

Mm-ah, mm-ah
In your head like, mm-ah, mm-ah
In your bed like, mm-ah, mm-ah
I'm just like, mm-ah, mm-ah
Right there like, mm-ah, mm-ah
Take it there like, mm-ah, mm-ah
Right there like, mm-ah, mm-ah
Mm-ah-mm, mm-ah, mm-ah (Ah)
In your head like, mm-ah, mm-ah
In your bed like, mm-ah, mm-ah
I'm just like, mm-ah, mm-ah
Right there like, mm-ah, mm-ah
Take it there like, mm-ah, mm-ah
Right there like, mm-ah, mm-ah
Mm-ah-mm, mm-ah, mm-ah
Mm-ah, mm-ah

'Cause you got that automatic kind of magic
Put it all on me, on me
And we can rendezvous, c'est voulez-vous
If you want to, we can go deep, deep, yeah
Do you wanna go deep, deep, deep, deep?
I'ma roll it like beep, beep, beep, beep
We can take a leap, leap, believe me
Turn it over like you turn a new leaf
Baby, you could come pick from my tree
Know I got it like sweet, sweet, sweet
All up in it 'til your knees go weak
All up in it 'til you exhale, breathe

Said, "Mm, that's all mine, spread
Mm, like a wildfire, like"
Mm, I don't mind, like (Ooh)
Mm, let's go twice, like (Ah)
Flip it, go, flip it (Ah)
Drippin' all in it
This kitty got that Midas touch
You turn to gold in it

I'm all yours (I'm all yours, I'm all, I'm all)
I'm all yours (I'm all, I'm all, I'm all)
From the stairs to the bed to the floor (I am all yours)
I'm all yours
You're all mine

Mm-ah, mm-ah
