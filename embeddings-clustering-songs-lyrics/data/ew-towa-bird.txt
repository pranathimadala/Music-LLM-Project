Call you up on the telephone
“Hello?”
I wonder what you’re doing if you’re home
"Alone?"
The way I feel about you stuck in my throat
I’m lovesick, I’m dying
I know it’s gross

Yeah, I want you
I want you in the worst way
You’re so sweet, it’s giving me a toothache
Tongue tied whenever you’re close
Can’t speak, knees weak
I know it’s gross

Love songs falling out my mouth
Trust me, I know how I sound
All I think about is you, I want you in my room
You’re so cute, I’m gonna puke
Like, “Ew”

Can I take you out, like, I dunno…
“Tonight?”
Hit the town or go down to the coast
“Alright.”
Tell me to hang up the call
We can do anything or everything or nothing at all

Love songs falling out my mouth
Trust me, I know how I sound
All I think about is you, I want you in my room
You’re so cute, I’m gonna puke
Like, “Ew”

You spin me around and round
Trust me, I know how I sound
I’d do anything to kiss
Honey dripping off your lips
Lick it up until I’m sick

Like, “Ew”

Like, “Ew”
Like, “Ew”

Yeah, I want ya
I want you in the worst way
You’re so sweet, it’s giving me a toothache
Yeah, I want ya
I want you in the worst way
I know it’s gross

Love songs falling out my mouth
Trust me, I know how I sound
All I think about is you, I want you in my room
You’re so cute, I’m gonna puke
Like, “Ew”

You spin me around and round
Trust me, I know how I sound
I’d do anything to kiss
Honey dripping off your lips
Lick it up until I’m sick

Like, “Ew”

Like, “Ew”

Like, “Ew”
Like, “Ew”
