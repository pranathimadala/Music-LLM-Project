'Cause it feels like Heaven when it hurts so bad
Baby, put it on me, I like it just like that, just like that

I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty, nasty, nasty

Is somebody gonna match my freak?
Is somebody gonna match my freak?
Is somebody gonna match my nasty?
I got stamina, they say I'm an athlete
Is somebody gonna match my freak? (Match my freak)
Need somebody with a good technique (Good technique)
Is somebody gonna match my nasty?
Pillow talking got my throat raspy

If you keep up with me, I'll keep on comin' back
If you do it too good, I'm gonna get attached
'Cause it feels like Heaven when it hurts so bad
Baby, put it on me, I like it just like that, just like that

I'vе been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty girl, nasty (Just like that)
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I'vе been a nasty, nasty, nasty (I like it just like that)
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty girl, nasty (Just like that)
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty, nasty, nasty

Big time, pull up, make a scene
Party's lame, no vibe, we can leave
Shotgun, my thighs on the seat
I ain't got nothin' underneath (Ooh)
Looks like you're 'bout to spend the night (Match my, match my freak)
Looks like I'm 'bout to change your life (Match my, match my freak)
Wife type, he's staying for a week
So I might just let him pay the lease

If you keep up with me, I'll keep on comin' back (Oh-woah-woah)
If you do it too good, I'm gonna get attached (Oh-woah-woah)
'Cause it feels like Heaven when it hurts so bad
Baby, put it on me, I like it just like that (Like it), just like that

I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty girl, nasty (Just like that)
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty, nasty, nasty (I like it just like that)
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty girl, nasty (Just like that)
I've been a nasty girl, nasty (Oh)
I've been a nasty, nasty, nasty

If you keep up with me, I'll keep on comin' back
If you do it too good, I'm gonna get attached
'Cause it feels like Heaven when it hurts so bad
Baby, put it on me, I like it just like that (Like it just like that), just like that

(Oh, ah, oh, ah) Nasty, nasty, nasty
(Oh, ah, oh, ah) Nasty, nasty, nasty
(Oh, ah, oh, ah) Nasty, nasty, nasty
(Oh, ah, oh, ah) Nasty, nasty, nasty
