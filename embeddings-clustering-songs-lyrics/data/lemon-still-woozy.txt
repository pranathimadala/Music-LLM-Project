Girl what do you
Want me to do
I can't handle when I make you cry
Though it's nothing new
I'm not somebody
Who's doing it right
But that just won't stop me
From trying tonight

Let me know it's all right
Girl you know just take your time
You know I'll never leave your side no
I know we're gonna be just fine
We're gonna be just fine

My bed feels so empty
But it smells like you
I think I'll try to take it with me
When I leave this fucking room
I think I gotta go I can't stay inside
I really wanna know
Where is your mind

Let me know it's all right
Girl you know just take your time
You know l'll never leave your side no
I know we're gonna be just fine
I know that we gon be just fine
I know that we gon be just fine

When you come around
I can't remember down
I can't remember down like magic when
I look through your eyes
And to my surprise
I see that the world is still alive

Let me know it's all right
Just take your time
I know that we gon be all right
It's gonna be just fine
We're gonna be just fine
