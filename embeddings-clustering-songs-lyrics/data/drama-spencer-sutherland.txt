I like the look of a cigarette, but I hate the way it tastes
I strike a pose, and when it glows, my cue to give it away
Woke up with an attitude, paint a smile on my face
Win or lose, you get to choose, when all the worlds a stage (today)
Pre:
Making a scene
Places to be
Living the dream!
Doing it for the
Drama (dra-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma)
Drama
Baby you know that you (Oh-oh-oh)
Wanna
Oh it feels good in the middle, whats life without a little
Drama
Faking my own funeral, just to see who cries
Then I walk in like im born again, cause I love a good surprise
Get drunk on a monday night, make love and then start a fight!
Wouldnt you want to laugh and cry at the movie of your life?
Doing it for the
Drama (dra-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma)
Drama
Baby you know that you (Oh-oh-oh)
Wanna
Oh it feels good in the middle, whats life without a little
Drama
-----gtr solo-----
So when the curtain closes, and its time for me to go
at least I can say that I gave them a show
dra-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Drama (dra-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma)
Drama
Baby you know that you (Oh-oh-oh)
Wanna
Oh it feels good in the middle, whats life without a little
Oh it feels good in the middle, whats life without a little
Oh it feels good in the middle, whats life without a little
Drama"
