We both lie silently still in the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together, we feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did?
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you
Yeah, I tried
But I guess that's why they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Yeah, it does

I listen to our favorite song, playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say, "Love's a game of easy come and easy go"
But I wonder, does he know?
Has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I, I could let you know somehow

Every rose has its thorn (Every rose, every rose, every rose)
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
(Every rose, every rose, every rose, yeah)
Every rose has its thorn

Though it's been a while now, I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But that scar, that scar remains (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Every rose, every rose
Every rose has its thorn

I know I could've saved a love that night if I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love, we both made our separate ways
And now, I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
And to hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

Every rose has its thorn (Every rose, every rose, every rose)
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
(Every rose, every rose, every rose, yeah)
Every rose has its thorn (Yeah, it does)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
