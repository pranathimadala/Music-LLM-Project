Rain is knockin' on my window
All I can think about is you though
Trees are shakin' in the ground
And I just wanted to have you around

Frida Kahlo, Frida Kahlo
I can't let go, I can't let go
You know, you know, you're right
You're goin', you're gone, goodnight

The birds are hidin' in their nests
But I might do somethin', somethin' I'll regret
I'm in the mourning of my life
When you left, everything turned to night

Frida Kahlo, Frida Kahlo
I can't let go, I can't let go
You know, you know, you're right (Right)
You're goin', you're gone, goodnight (Night)

Frida Kahlo, Frida Kahlo
I can't let go, I can't let go
You know, you know, you're right (Right)
You took, you took flight (Flight)
Well, I tried (I can't let go)
I tried to say goodbye
(I can't let go)
