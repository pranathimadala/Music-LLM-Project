One day, when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine"

He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars
Float above the floor

We drove around in a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah, woo

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine"

I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Kelly Clarkson
I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
(Seventh album, seventh album)

He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine, oh

He said, "I've been to the year 3000" (Yeah, yeah)
"Not much has changed, but they lived underwater" (Oh, yeah)
"And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine, doin' fine"

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater" (Oh, yeah)
"And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine"

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine"
