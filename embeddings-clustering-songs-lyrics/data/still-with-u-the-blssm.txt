You tell me you’re in Brooklyn and here I am still wishing
I'm running for the subway and crying every Sunday and then I buy a new chain
Watching while the days go, crashing into waves yeah, down the drain, oh let's go

I wanted everything that you wanted, wanted too, wanted, wanted too
I wanted everything, did you want me, want me, too, want me, want me too

Everything is alright, feeling good but not quite
Acting like you’re brand new, I never wanted your truth
Everything is alright, feeling good but not quite
Watch me as I cruise through all the things you left bruised
Here I am, yeah here I am still with you
Here I am, yeah feeling stupid feeling used
Here I am, yeah (here I am still with you)
Uh, uh, uh (feeling stupid, feeling stupid)

Playing with the sunlight, twisting shapes in your eyes
Laying watching TV, I'm faded with a soft breeze
Kisses on my cheekbones, I buy you shit I don't know
Why I need you here now
Should take my dog and just bounce

Everything is alright, feeling good but not quite
Acting like you’re brand new, I never wanted your truth
Everything is alright, feeling good but not quite
Watch me as I cruise through all the things you left bruised
Here I am, yeah here I am still with you
Here I am, yeah feeling stupid feeling used
Here I am, yeah (here I am still with you)
Uh, uh, uh (feeling stupid, feeling stupid)

Playing with the sunlight, twisting shapes in your eyes
Laying watching TV, I'm faded with a soft breeze
Kisses on my cheekbones, I buy you shit I don't know
Why I need you here now
Should take my dog and just bounce

Everything is alright, feeling good but not quite
Acting like you’re brand new, I never wanted your truth
Everything is alright, feeling good but not quite
Watch me as I cruise through all the things you left bruised
Everything is alright, feeling good but not quite
Acting like you’re brand new, I never wanted your truth
Everything is alright, feeling good but not quite
Watch me as I cruise through all the things you left bruised
Here I am, yeah here I am still with you
Here I am, yeah feeling stupid feeling used
Here I am, yeah
Uh, uh, uh
