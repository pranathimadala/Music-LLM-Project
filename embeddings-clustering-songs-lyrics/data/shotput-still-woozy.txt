What can I say?
You'll always get your way with me
Just barely five foot
You hit like a shot put and you got me

Can't keep a straight face, that's not how I was made
I know you are the same, so fuck with this charade
I can see you blushing red and I know you hate that
But I can't help it if I like it, so I don't react
But I know something's growing
Never can stop it from showing
I think we gotta just got get going, oh

What can I say?
You'll always get your way with me
Just barely five foot
You hit like a shot put and you got me

Feels right, baby, it feels right
Yeah, it just feels right, right to me
In the night, in the dead of the night
We make the wrong things right eventually

Well, I wasn't holding out hope for me
Already making up my mind that l'd be lonely
Then a little grin for the win and I know just what you want from me
Guarantee

My heart, oh, my heart is stone
Melting just like honeycomb

Feels right, baby, it feels right
Yeah, it just feels right, right to me
In the night, in the dead of the night
We make the wrong things right eventually

In the dead of night
In the dead of night
In the dead of night
In the dead of night
