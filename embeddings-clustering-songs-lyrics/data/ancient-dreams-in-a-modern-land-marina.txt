Our ancestors had to fight to survive
Just so we could have a chance of a life
We're not here so we can blow it all
We could bear witness to the rise and the fall

Ancient dreams in a modern land
I'm trying to get back as fast I can
Back to a time before I had form
Back to a time before I was born

You don't have to be like everybody else
You don't have to fit into the norm
You are not here to conform
I am here to take a look inside myself
Recognize that I could be the eye, the eye of the storm

I am not my body, not my mind or my brain (Ha!)
Not my thoughts or feelings, I am not my DNA
I am the observer, I'm a witness of life
I live in the space between the stars and the sky

What's your purpose, why were you put on Earth?
You could be lost but you belong to the world
We're now living in a seminal age
The walls are being broken and we're ready for change

Ancient dreams in a modern land
I'm trying to get back as fast I can
Back to a time before I had form
Back to a time before I was born

You don't have to be like everybody else
You don't have to fit into the norm
You are not here to conform
I am here to take a look inside myself
Recognize that I could be the eye, the eye of the storm

I am not my body, not my mind or my brain (Ha!)
Not my thoughts or feelings, I am not my DNA
I am the observer, I'm a witness of life
I live in the space between the stars and the sky

From the heart of Malaysia
To the dark Himalayas
From the day you were born
You are not here to conform

You don't have to be like everybody else
You don't have to fit into the norm
You are not here to conform
I am here to take a look inside myself
Recognize that I could be the eye, the eye of the storm

I am not my body, not my mind or my brain (Ha!)
Not my thoughts or feelings, I am not my DNA
I am the observer, I'm a witness of life
I live in the space between the stars and the sky
