Did I dream the whole thing?
Was I just a nightmare?
Different dimensions
Stuck in the Twilight Zone
Is this a black and white scene?
If so, then I'm in the gray one
Hope you win for best actor
'Cause I had you completely wrong
Does she know
You're not who you say you are?
'Cause I might give her a call
Or was I just not me at all?

And
It's not like I'm still not over you
It's so strange
This, I never do
Not that I miss you, I don't
Sometimes I just can't believe
You happened
It's not like I'd ever change a thing
'Cause I'm right here
Where I'm meant to be
Not that I'd call you, I won't
Sometimes I just can't believe
You happened

Were we just mistaken?
Disguised our intentions?
Our nest was a masquerade
Why do I still protect you?
Pretend these songs aren't about you
Hope this might be the last one
'Cause I'm not foolin' anyone
Does she know?
You're not who you say you are
'Cause I might give her a call
Or was I just not me at all

And
It's not like I'm still not over you
It's so strange
This, I never do
Not that I miss you, I don't
Sometimes I just can't believe
You happened
It's not like I'd ever change a thing
'Cause I'm right here
Where I'm meant to be
Not that I'd call you, I won't
Sometimes I just can't believe
You happened

It's not like I'm
Over you
It's so strange
I don't miss you
Not that I miss you, I don't
Sometimes I just can't believe
Can't believe
You happened
