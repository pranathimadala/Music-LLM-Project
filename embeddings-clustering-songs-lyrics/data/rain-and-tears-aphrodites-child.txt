Rain and tears
Rain and tears are the same
But in the sun
You've got to play the game
When you cry in winter time
You can pretend
It's nothing but the rain
How many times I've seen
Tears coming from your blue eyes
Rain and tears are the same
But in the sun
You've got to play the game
Give me an answer of love
I need an answer of love
Rain and tears in the sun
But in your heart
You feel the rainbow waves
Rain and tears both I shun
For in my heart
There'll never be a sun
Rain and tears are the same
But in the sun
You've got to play the game
