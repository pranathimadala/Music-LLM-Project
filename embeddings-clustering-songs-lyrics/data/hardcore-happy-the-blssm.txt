I used to call your pup Colorado (Colorado)
I burnt you a CD with Slayer and Dipset, it lasted 'til the morning
(Oh, could this be every day?)

Acting kinda lazy
I've been lookin' out the window
I'm just tryna make some sense
Of all this shit, it's kinda mental
I've been— (I said I missed you, I lied, but)
When my tummy's feeling fuzzy
I just want them all to want me
I just want them all to need me
I just need them all to love me
I just— (I'm insecure when the sun goes down)

All I want, yeah, I want hardcore
(Hardcore happy)
All night long, big planes flying by
(Hardcore happy)
And another day just slips away
And I'll be alright, just lean and sway
And I'm stuck inside and terrified
So press rewind in this 1999 Mercedes

Yeah, you know my world is burnin'
I've been sick of all my hurtin'
Yeah, I'm tired of my gender
I spent five days on a bender
I've been— (I said I missed you, I lied but)
And when I'm starin' at the mirror
I just want them all to like me
I just want them all to need me
I just need them all to love me
I just—, I just—

All I want, yeah, I want hardcore
(Hardcore happy)
All night long, big planes flying by
(Hardcore happy)
And another day just slips away
And I'll be alright, just lean and sway
And I'm stuck inside and terrified
So press rewind in this 1999 Mercedes

1999, 1999
1999, 1999
1999, 1999
1999, 1999

All I want, yeah, I want hardcore
(Hardcore happy)
All night long, big planes flying by
(Hardcore happy)
